Python code for a BMI Calculator app. This app calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the userâ€™s weight and height and gives a quick health assessment based on BMI ranges.

How It Works
The calculate_bmi function takes weight and height as inputs, calculates BMI, and rounds it to two decimal places.
The bmi_category function checks the BMI and returns a corresponding health category.
The main function prompts the user for weight and height, calls the other functions, and displays the results.
Usage
Run this code in a Python environment.
Enter your weight (kg) and height (m) when prompted, and the app will display your BMI and health category.
